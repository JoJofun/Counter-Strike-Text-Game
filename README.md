# Counter-Strike-Text-Game
This is a game I made for a data structures class a few years ago as my final project
It is meant to simulate the game counter strike and features the implementation of a variety of data structures and implementation of a pathfinding algorithm
sjf_dust2.txt is a map you could play it on
